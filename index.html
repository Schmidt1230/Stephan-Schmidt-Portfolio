                <p>The work consisted of creating a linked graph database from Fluree, the Fluree database was hosted using a Docker Server Image from Fluree and then
                   making HTTP API calls to the server using Postman, it was also required of me to create Python tools which could automate the process a bit by extracting text from PDF and 
                converting RDF Turtle triples into JSON-LD (Java Script Object Notation for Linked Data). </p>
