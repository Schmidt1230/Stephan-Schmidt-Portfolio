                   making HTTP API calls to the server using Postman, it was also required of me to create Python tools which could automate the process a bit by extracting text from PDF and

                <h3>2020 + 2021</h3>
                <p>For two years after High-School I had the amazing opportunity to work in the United States, the goal of these two years were to gather finances so I could finance my own studies debt-free. The work experience I gathered here might not seem relevant in the IT industry, the technical skills I've learned during my time abroad certainly might not be applicable behind a desk, the personal
                    personal skills I've developed will most certainly prove to be an asset in any work environment. When I worked in the states I was thrown in very uncertain situations where I had to adapt and preservere through  these
                    challenging times. I developed the ability to communicate with my team, how to manage my time especially in high stress environments, how to stay calm under pressure and uncertainty. And also leadership and how to take charge
                    when needed, and also how to drive a tractor ;) .A big part of the man I am today was due to the two years I had spent in the United States and the challenges I had to overcome there.

                <p>ChatterBox is a Python desktop application using the library Tkinter and Customtkinter.
                    The platform uses Google's Firebase to store User information. The application encrypts user passwords using a hash library and encrypts using the user's password. ChatterBox allows Users to add a friend and message them directly with real-time message updates, this is done using a "listener"
                    method which monitors the Firebase database for updates (Changes). 
                    There is also a feature for group messaging between multiple users.
