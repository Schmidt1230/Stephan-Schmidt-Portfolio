            <h2 class = "abt-me">Intro</h2>
            <p>I am a persistent and dedicated worker, adaptable to change, and always striving to be the best version of myself. I am loyal and an excellent communicator. I enjoy challenges and take pride in constructing creative solutions to overcome them. I value and respect those around me and appreciate diverse backgrounds. I thrive under pressure and relish opportunities to present my or my team's work to others. I have a natural curiosity for the structure and functioning of something, I like to know why something is the way it is and why it functions the way it does. In my spare time I enjoy 
                reading up on new advancements in the technological and coding space, especially new developments in Artificial Intelligence. 
            </p>
            <h2 class = "abt-me">Time-line</h2>
            <p>2000-2019</p>
            <p>I grew up in a small town in Limpopo, I went to Primary and High-School in this town. I played various sports such as Rugby. I spent my whole childhood in this town and will always have fond memories regarding Modimolle.</p>
            <p>2020-2021</p>
            <p>I went to the United States of America to work as a farm-equipment operator. During my time abroad I had the opportunity to learn essential work skills. I learned to communicate, how to solve my own problems, how to adapt to difficult challenges, how to presevere during challenging times, and how to work effectively in a team.</p>
            <p>2022-204</p>
            <p>I studied my a degree in BSc Information Technology. In my first year I obtained a membership into the Golden Key Honours Society for my marks.
                In my second and third year I worked as a student assistant for CMPG 122 and CMPG 212, these modules are consisted of teaching students C# in the .NET framework and also a bit more about relational databases using
                SQL server.

                <p>For two years after High-School I had the amazing opportunity to work in the United States, the goal of these two years were to gather finances so I could finance my own studies debt-free. The work experience I gathered here might not seem relevant in the IT industry, the technical skills I've learned during my time abroad certainly might not be applicable behind a desk, the personal
                    personal skills I've developed will most certainly prove to be an asset in any work environment. When I worked in the states I was thrown in very uncertain situations where I had to adapt and preservere through  these
                    challenging times. I developed the ability to communicate with my team, how to manage my time especially in high stress environments, how to stay calm under pressure and uncertainty. And also leadership and how to take charge
                    when needed, and also how to drive a tractor ;) .A big part of the man I am today was due to the two years I had spent in the United States and the challenges I had to overcome there.

                <p>ChatterBox is a Python desktop application using the library Tkinter and Customtkinter.
                    The platform uses Google's Firebase to store User information. The application encrypts user passwords using a hash library and encrypts using the user's password. ChatterBox allows Users to add a friend and message them directly with real-time message updates, this is done using a "listener"
                    method which monitors the Firebase database for updates (Changes). 
                    There is also a feature for group messaging between multiple users.
